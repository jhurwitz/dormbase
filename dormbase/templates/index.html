      <p>Dormbase is a web-based system that provides MIT
      dormitories with the tools and services they need for daily
      operation. It is an open source software project that was
      started by <a href="http://simmons.mit.edu" target="blank">Simmons Tech</a> in response to their
      and the resident’s need for reliable, modern, and user-friendly
      online services. Dormbase means a consistent user experience
      across all of MIT’s dorms, accessible to residents, desk
      workers, and administration. It is a community project that
      solves a community problem.</p>

      <p>MIT’s current dormitory systems are not representative of the
      Institute. They lack oversight and are highly fragmented,
      making updates and maintenance difficult. These systems are
      also unfriendly. Information is obscured by poorly designed
      interfaces and fundamental use cases are time
      consuming. Inadequate attention was paid to the user’s needs,
      dissuading residents from taking advantage of online
      resources.</p>

      <p>Dormbase offers what no other system on campus can: It just works.</p>
